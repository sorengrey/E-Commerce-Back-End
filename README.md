### Description
This application allows an online shop to keep track of a database full of products, categories, and their associated tags.
While there is no front-end webpage, there are still routes that can be used along with Postman to complete tasks such as:
  <ul><li>Viewing all categories, products, and tags.</li>
      <li>Viewing a single category, product, or tag.</li>
      <li>Creating a new category, product, or tag.</li>
      <li>Updating a category, product, or tag.</li>
      <li>Deleting a category, product, or tag.</li>
  </ul>
